My name is Marcin Kurczych and I use the first four consonants of my surname --- so krcz --- as a nickname. You probably have no idea how to pronounce it and neither do I. If you really want to try, you can try _kurt͡ʂ_ ("koortsh") or _kurt͡ʂɨ_ (closest approximation being "koor-tsheh"), but when referring to me it's best to use my first name, _Mart͡ɕin_ ("Martsin").

Mathematics, Computer Science, and Psychology are my main interests. I studied all three as a part of an interdisciplinary programme, even though I only have a degree in the first one. I always strive for a deep understanding of concepts I learn so that I can use them intuitively, not only repetitively apply them. I consider myself a generalist; I have knowledge of many tools and theoretical areas without a strong focus on one or a few of them. It helps me to see the big picture, quickly dive into new problems, and navigate smoothly through a large amount of knowledge and documentation.

I work as a Software Development independent contractor. Most of my experience is in Scala, but I can work with other languages (Rust, Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, Java, and more) when needed. Because of my participation in programming competitions in high school and studying at the University of Warsaw, I have exceptional knowledge of algorithms, computational complexity, and analysis of correctness.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, riding a bike, fiddling with microcontrollers. I like good food, Italian, Mexican, and Thai being my favourite cuisines. I live in a post-industrial city of Łódź which is beautiful in its specific way, with some of its old brick-made factories still being abandoned.
